External libraries, such as lucene, should be installed to the top-level lib/
directory. This will allow all assignments to share the libraries. If possible,
please automated the downloading and unpacking of libraries inside the 'setup'
script.

Each assignment gets its own maven project, created in a naming scheme of
A{1..99}. For example, the first homework resides in the A1/ directory. In
each of these projects, a setup.sh can be found for installing and configuring
project dependencies. To compile the source code, use the command `mvm compile`

For first time setup:
	- install maven on your computer
	- run the top-level setup.sh
	- cd into A1 and run setup.sh
	- There you go!
